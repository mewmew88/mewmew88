 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mehr-Un-Nasa
ðŸ‘€ I am a qualifed dental nurse and a full-time student studying Operating Department Practitoner in univeristy. I decided to learn front-end development as a hobby as it was something I always had an interest in (time travel back to hi5 and Bebo time) creating templates and editing them to suit my needs. I self taught myself how to use photoshop using youtube tutorials and deviantart. 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a huge Marvel fan, ![CaptainAmericaAvengersGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117365645/205670353-756937f2-27a7-49de-87bf-100cd72821e8.gif) with an odd like of DC here and there ![WhySoSeriousGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117365645/205670918-04cf8c8f-57b3-417c-bc54-94dd4abaea8e.gif)
