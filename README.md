 ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mehr-Un-Nasa
ğŸ‘€ I am a qualifed dental nurse and a full-time student studying Operating Department Practitoner in univeristy. I decided to learn front-end development as a hobby as it was something I always had an interest in (time travel back to hi5 and Bebo time) creating templates and editing them to suit my needs. I self taught myself how to use photoshop using youtube tutorials and deviantart. 
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m a huge Marvel fan with an odd like of DC here and there
